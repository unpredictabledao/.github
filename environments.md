**Currently, there are very few to no participant in the DAO, we suggest you to deploy the contracts on your own to try it out**. Resources about this can be found at https://github.com/unpredictabledao/unpredictabledao-contracts. Tutorials on deploying contracts to ICE's Arctic Testnet, Acala's Mandala Testnet and Astar's Shibuya Testnet are also available there.
